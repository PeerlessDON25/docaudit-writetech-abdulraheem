# Assessment: Documentation Repo Audit

Perform a short audit of this repositoryâ€™s documentation structure. Your audit should include:

- **Folder structure:** Describe the main folders and their purposes.
- **Observations on documentation organization:** How are the docs, blog, and pages organized? Are there any conventions or patterns?
- **Suggestions for improvement:** Note any areas where the structure or organization could be improved for clarity, scalability, or maintainability.

**Instructions:**

2. Review the folder and file structure.
3. Submit your audit as a Markdown file named `audit.md` in the root of the repo.

**Some things to consider:**

- Are there redundant or unclear files/folders?
- How could the structure be improved for a larger project?
